# General

## Configuration
All of your configuration options are set in the `config.json` file in your timetracker folder.
This file is automatically generated the first time you run TimeTracker and can be filled out from
there. The file's contents will follow this schema:
```json
{
	"db_url": "sqlite:///timetracker.db",
	"signout_code": "000000",
	"minimum_hours": 1
}
```
The db_url parameter is the URL for your database connection 
(defaults to a no-config-required SQLite database, only change if following [this](advanced.md)).

The signout_code parameter is what can be entered instead of a student ID to automatically 
sign everyone out. Defaults to 000000, recommend changing.

The minimum_hours parameter is used to specify how many hours a member must have to be considered
as having made hours. This does not affect anything other than the Has Made Hours column on the
report, however you can look at the hours column to see for yourself.

## Adding members
Invoke TimeTracker with the --add-users flag. You will get dumped into a console where you enter user IDs and names and
they are added to the database automatically.

## Reports
Launch the web server using the correct invocation for your system, and visit http://localhost:5000/report 
to access a report of how many hours everyone has been signed in for, as well as a column specifying whether they have
made hours or not.
